name: build_tgt
long_name: Build target
extends: tgt
description: |
  A build target is either an executable, shared library, static library,
  both shared and static library or shared module.

methods:
- name: full_path
  returns: str
  description: |
    Returns a full path pointing to the result target file.
    **NOTE:** In most cases using the object itself will do the same job
    as this and will also allow Meson to setup inter-target dependencies
    correctly. Please file a bug if that doesn't work for you.

- name: path
  returns: str
  since: 0.59.0
  deprecated: 0.59.0
  description: |
    Does the exact same as [[build_tgt.full_path]]. **NOTE**: This
    function is solely kept for compatebility with [[@external_program]] objects.
    It will be removed once the, also deprecated, corresponding `path()`
    function in the [[@external_program]] object is removed.

- name: name
  returns: str
  since: 0.54.0
  description: Returns the name of the target.

- name: found
  returns: bool
  since: 0.59.0
  description: |
    Always returns `true`. This function is meant to make executables
    objects feature compatible with [[@external_program]] objects. This
    simplifies use-cases where an executable is used instead of
    an [[@external_program]].
